Description: Provides functionality for selecting and analyzing individuals in 
             two-phase genetic association studies. Phase 1 data usually come 
             from GWAS results and we assume phase 2 genetic data will be part 
             of a targeted genome sequencing / fine-mapping study. 
             The package assists in selecting a subset of individuals that 
             will be sequenced for phase 2. Once phase 2 data have been collected, 
             the package implements methods to analyze phase 1 and 2 data 
             together using semi-parametric regression models.
