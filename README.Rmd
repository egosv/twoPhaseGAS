## twoPhaseGAS

Two-Phase Genetic Association Study design and analysis with missing covariates by design

## Description

Provides functionality for selecting and analyzing individuals in two-phase genetic association studies. Phase 1 data usually come from GWAS results and we assume phase 2 genetic data will be part of a targeted genome sequencing/fine-mapping study. The package assists in selecting a subset of individuals that will be sequenced for phase 2. Once phase 2 data have been collected, the package implements methods to analyze phase 1 and 2 data together using semi-parametric regression models.


## Installation

You can install the current version of `twoPhaseGAS` from [GitHub](https://github.com) using (`devtools` required):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
